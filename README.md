# Quant_Fin_CCNY-BIZ-BETZ_Spring_2024_SF_MM
  ### Hello and Welcome 
  ### This repo aims to hold all our projects and assignments for the City College of New York's quantitative finance class.
  ### The names of the collaborators of this project are as follows:

  ## Project #1: [Portfolio Analysis](https://github.com/CCNY-Analytics-and-Quant/Quant_Fin_CCNY-BIZ-BETZ_Spring_2024_SF_MM_NI/blob/main/Portfolio_Analysis_Project/port_analysis_clean.ipynb)
  
  This project aims to conduct a risk analysis of a seven-stock portfolio against major market indices, specifically the S&P500 (SPY). The requirements for this project involves creating detailed pandas tables showcasing constituent stock risk analysis and portfolio risk metrics against the S&P500 ETF. These tables encompass various factors such as volatility, beta, drawdowns, total return, correlation, covariance, tracking errors, and Sharpe ratio. Additionally, a correlation matrix is generated to illustrate the relationships between the equal-weighted portfolio, ETFs, and individual stocks. Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries are used in this repository to research and incorporate relevant formulas into the Python code to execute this project effectively.

  ## Project #2: [Efficient Frontier](https://github.com/CCNY-Analytics-and-Quant/Quant_Fin_CCNY-BIZ-BETZ_Spring_2024_SF_MM_NI/blob/main/efficient_frontier/efficient_frontier_clean.ipynb)

  This project aims to implement the Markowitz Efficient Frontier theory by selecting a basket of seven assets, calculating their individual risk/return values, combining them into the efficient frontier, and plotting the results. The Markowitz theory dictates that investors seek portfolios that maximize expected return for a given level of risk or minimize risk for a given level of expected return. The efficient frontier represents the set of mean-variance combinations where, for a given risk, no other portfolio offers a higher expected return. The requirements include choosing assets with significant historical data, retrieving daily price data for the previous 2 years, calculating mean, variance, and correlation matrix, computing the efficient frontier and optimal weights, and graphing the results using Matplotlib or Seaborn libraries. The output includes optimal weightings, the efficient frontier, and correlation matrix charts saved to a file. In this python code a Monte-Carlo and regression simulation is used to derive the efficient frontier in compliance with Markowitz Efficient Frontier Theory rules. A Python class is utilized to modulize the efficient frontier model.

  ## Project #2: [Quant Model Price Momentum Factors](https://github.com/CCNY-Analytics-and-Quant/Quant_Fin_CCNY-BIZ-BETZ_Spring_2024_SF_MM_NI/blob/main/berry_cox_price_momentum_port_gen/Berry_Cox_price_momentum_factors_clean.ipynb)

  This project involves utilizing Berry Cox's price momentum factors to construct a long-short portfolio and backtesting the algorithm over a 5-year period to evaluate its performance. Alpha factors are quantifiable metrics used to identify sources of alpha generated by assets. The primary objective is to select assets for the portfolio based on Berry Cox's list of alpha factors and conduct backtesting to assess the algorithm's efficacy. The requirements include choosing an ETF with a minimum of 100 assets, retrieving historical data, calculating price momentum factors, computing monthly z-factor scores to normalize the factors, identifying long and short baskets, creating a backtest, and charting monthly portfolio returns, long picks vs. short picks, and cumulative portfolio returns against the ETF. The project was further expanded to include the Markowitz Efficient Frontier Theory, the code previously used to build the efficient frontier with the Monte-Carlo and regression simulation was converted into python script. The Python script file was then imported into the price momentum factors model file to run and identify the optimal weightings of a portfolio after identifying the long-short stock tickers picks from the price-momentum factors. This allowed us to create a optimized portfolio that gives the highest level of return for the best level of risk based on the selection of stocks from the price momentum factors. 
  
  The optimal portfolio was back tested to prove the concept of both the best selection of stocks and the optimal weightings of those stocks within a portfolio.
